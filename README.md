# Covid-19-Data-Analysis
This project involves conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Covid-19 Dataset and the Vaccination Dataset for two years. The goal is to gain insights and identify sales trends across various dimensions. It also involves visualizing the global Covid-19 Dataset on the Tableau Software.

# Tech Stack
The project utilizes the following Python libraries:

* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Plotly

# Tools Used 
* Google Colab

# Dataset Exploration and Cleaning 
*  The dataset is imported into a pandas DataFrame for analysis.
*  Initial data exploration includes examining the data frame's structure, dimensions, and columns, renaming some names, and dropping the irrelevant ones.
*  Null values in the dataset are identified and addressed, ensuring data integrity.
*  The data types of specific columns are modified to facilitate analysis.

  # Visualizations 
The project includes a range of visualizations to uncover the Covid-19 impact and vaccination status in various states. Some of the key visualizations performed are:
* Barplot - Displaying states with the most active cases and the most deaths
* Lineplot - To show the top 5 affected states
* Pieplot - comparing vaccination status of Males vs Females.
* Plots to show the most and the least vaccinated states across India.
* Appropriate labels and titles for clarity and understanding accompany each visualization.
